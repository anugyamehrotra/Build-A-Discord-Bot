A personalized sample project: a simple **Interactive Discord Bot** built for the AI/ML room in **NP Hacks**.

This sample demonstrates foundational Python development concepts using only **Python** and **APIs**. It is designed to help students understand how to use Python constructs to design unique, expandable bots for online platforms, such a `Discord`, with the help of external APIs.

To access all API keys;
  ### Discord API:
  - Create a Discord Account @ `discord.com `
  - Head to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) & open `Get Started`
  - Click `Create New Application` & set a name
  - Head to `Bot`, Select `Reset Token` & copy the new token to add to your bot

(For bot functionality, Go to `Bot`, scroll down & select `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`, go back to `OAuth2`, select `bot` & `Send Messages` in **TEXT PERMISSIONS**, then copy the generated URL to invite to your sever & begin coding!)

  ### Tenor API:
  - Follow this comprehensive [tutorial](https://developers.google.com/tenor/guides/quickstart)
  - Copy the API Key & insert into the dedicate variable in the code

### üìÅ Clone The Repository  
First, clone the portfolio Repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anugyamehrotra/Build-A-Discord-Bot.git
cd Build-A-Discord-Bot

# üß© Key Features

### ‚úçÔ∏è 1. Dynamic Chat Interactions & Greetings
- Responds naturally to a wide range of greetings (`hello`, `hey`, `yo`, `hiya`, etc.).  
- Engages in multi-step conversation flows ‚Äî sends different replies depending on whether it‚Äôs the first message or a follow-up.  
- Includes **Magic 8-ball responses** for fun, randomized replies via (`$8ball`).  

### üé≠ 2. Meme & GIF Generator
- `$meme` ‚Äî Fetches a random meme from the **Meme API** (`https://meme-api.com/gimme`) and posts it directly in chat.  
- `$gif` ‚Äî Uses the **Tenor API** to search and return an animated GIF based on user query.  
- All content is pulled dynamically with **HTTP requests** and parsed from JSON using Tenor API services.
